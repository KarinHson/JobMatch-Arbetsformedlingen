# Title

## 🗺️ Description
JobMatch is a React web application designed to make it easy for users to search, browse, and explore job ads through the official JobTech API from Arbetsförmedlingen.
The app provides a smooth way to look for open positions by keyword, view details about employers, and access application information directly from the listings.

The interface is built using Arbetsförmedlingen’s design system to ensure accessibility and a consistent structure. To give the project its own identity, a custom logo and new color palette were introduced, distinguishing it from Arbetsförmedlingen’s original branding.

## 🗝️ Project Features
This website includes several key features:

- 🔍 Search functionality – Users can search for jobs by keyword(s)

- 📑 Job listings – Browse paginated job ads with essential details (headline, employer, publication date, etc.)

- 📝 Detailed job view – Open a single job ad with full description, employer info, and application details

- 📭 No results page – Friendly fallback if no job matches are found

- 🧭 Navigation – Custom header and footer with links to Home and Job Listings

- ⚠️ Error handling – Dedicated error page for different HTTP error codes

- 🎨 Custom styling – Modified Arbetsförmedlingen design system with personalized colors and logos
